## PolynomialRegresssion

This project is about solving a basic polynomial of the 3rd degree using Polynomial Regression

## Motivation
This project was a part of Assignment 1 of the "Deep Learning Lab" course at USI, Lugano taken by [Dr. Kazuki Irie](https://people.idsia.ch/~kazuki/).

## Tech used
<b>Built with</b>
- [Python3](https://www.python.org)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org)
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org)

## Features
The project includes implementation and exploration of the following ideas related to Linear Regression:
- Effect of increasing and decreasing number of training samples on:
    1. Evolution of relation between training and validation losses
    2. Final prediction of coefficients
- Effect of increasing noise in training data on:
    1. Evolution of relation between training and validation losses
    2. Final prediction of coefficients
